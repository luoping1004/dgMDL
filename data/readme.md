This folder contains preprocessed data that can be used to test the program.

The four 'npy' files are the raw features extracted for genes and diseases in the PPI-based and GO-based models.

"InBioList.txt" contains all the genes being analyzed in the study.
"GeneList_v1.1.txt" contains all the disease-associated genes.

"Classified_disease_id.txt" contains the classified OMIM IDs of the 1154 diseases analyzed in the study. For those diseases without official IDs, a temporary ID is assigned for each of them at the end of the file.

"5foldIdx_shuffle_RN" contains the indices of the disease-gene pairs used in the 5-fold cross-validation. In the _de novo_ prediction, the training and testing indices are concatenated to generate known data which are used to train the multimodel DBN.


The association matrix file "Adj_v1.1.npy" is larger than 25 mb which cannot be uploaded to github. But it can be obtained from the following two cloud drives.
